# EXpression-based Telomerase Enzymatic activity Detection (EXTEND)

EXTEND (EXpression-based Telomerase ENzymatic activity Detection) is an R package used for prediction of telomerase activities using gene expression data from different platforms including microarrays and RNA-sequencing (for bulk and single cell data). 

Input Data: Gene expression data in the form of 2-dimensional matrix is required as an input, where rows corresponds to gene names (official gene symbols) and column names corresponds to samples.

Output: Output is generated in the form of text file containing telomerase (EXTEND scores) in raw and normalized formats.

Useage: EXTEND requires devtools for installation purpose.
